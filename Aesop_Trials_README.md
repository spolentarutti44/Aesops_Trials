## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**MVP Implementation**

- Basic game loop with Bevy states
- Simple grid-based movement system
- Basic tile rendering with placeholder graphics
- Player character with health/stats
- Simple room generation (rectangular rooms)
- Basic collision detection

**Deliverable**: Playable character that can move around a simple generated room

### Phase 2: Combat & Enemies (Weeks 4-6)
**Battle System Implementation**

- ARPG Action combat Mechanics
- Enemy AI with basic pathfinding
- Damage calculation system
- Health/death mechanics
- Basic enemy types (3-5 creatures)
- Combat UI elements

**Deliverable**: Functional combat system with multiple enemy types

### Phase 3: Dungeon Generation (Weeks 7-9)
**Procedural Content**

- Advanced room generation with varied layouts
- Corridor connection algorithms
- Multi-floor dungeons with stairs/transitions
- Room type variety (combat, treasure, boss, special)
- Trap placement system
- Loot generation mechanics

**Deliverable**: Complex, multi-floor dungeons with varied content

### Phase 4: RPG Systems (Weeks 10-12)
**Character Progression**

- Experience/leveling system
- Skill trees with meaningful choices
- Equipment system with stats/bonuses
- Inventory management UI
- Item rarity and special effects
- Character customization options

**Deliverable**: Full RPG progression with equipment and skills

### Phase 5: Mythological Content (Weeks 13-15)
**Theme Implementation**

- Aasop's fables / brothers grim inspired charactesr and abilities
- People are hidden animal hybrids with the pertaining animals ability
- Similar to a druid but they are more in human form then fully shifted to an animal
- An example is that the main protagonist can take on the form of a Hawk which would allow him to levitate around obsticles
- Another exaample is a bear where the protogonist gets more health and is tankier
- Mythological boss encounters
- Boss's can be similar hybrids but different from the ones the main character can become
- Divine artifact special items
- Lore integration through item descriptions/dialog
- Old dark Germanic theme
- Atmospheric audio design

**Deliverable**: Fully themed experience with mythological elements

### Phase 6: Polish & Balance (Weeks 16-18)
**Game Refinement**

- Balance testing for difficulty curves
- Bug fixes and optimization
- UI/UX improvements
- Save/load system implementation
- Settings menu with options
- Tutorial or introductory content

**Deliverable**: Polished, balanced game ready for release

## Core Game Systems Detail

### 🎯 Combat System
```rust
// Turn-based combat with action points
pub struct CombatSystem;

impl Plugin for CombatSystem {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app
            .add_systems(Update, (
                initiative_system,       // Initiative order based on speed/agility
                action_system,           // Action types: Move, Attack, Use Item, Special Ability
                damage_calculation,      // Damage calculation with armor/resistance
                status_effect_system,    // Status effects (poison, blessing, curse)
            ).chain())
    }
}
```

### 🏗️ Dungeon Generation Algorithm
```rust
// Procedural generation approach
pub fn generate_dungeon(commands: &mut Commands, assets: &AssetServer) {
    // 1. Generate rooms with random sizes/positions
    // 2. Create minimum spanning tree for connections
    // 3. Add extra connections for loops (33% chance)
    // 4. Place corridors between connected rooms
    // 5. Populate rooms with content based on type
    // 6. Add environmental details and traps
}
```

### 📊 Progression System
```rust
// Character advancement mechanics
pub struct Stats {
    // Base stats
    strength: f32,
    agility: f32,
    vitality: f32,
    wisdom: f32,
    
    // Derived stats
    health: f32,
    mana: f32,
    attack: f32,
    defense: f32,
    speed: f32,
}

// Skill trees: Warrior, Hunter, Mystic paths
// Equipment slots: Weapon, Shield, Armor, Accessories
// Divine blessings: Temporary buffs from completing trials
```
